## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r books}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r zoo animals, echo=FALSE}
zooAnimals <- read.csv("zooAnimal_medianLifeExpectancy_Jul2018 .csv", header = TRUE)
skim(zooAnimals)
hist(zooAnimals$Male.MLE, main ="Life Expectancies of Male Animals")
hist(zooAnimals$Male.MLE, main ="Life Expectancies of FeMale Animals")
boxplot(zooAnimals$Male.MLE)
boxplot(zooAnimals$Female.MLE)



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
